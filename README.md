# Jaz
##Dynamic web page rendering
Load and render web pages through the use of history API and AJAX to
provide a seamless and smooth transition. Jaz takes predetermined
contents of web pages and dynamically renders them onto the current
page, while asynchronously utilizing history API to navigate the user to
that web page, ultimately providing a smooth page transition.

##Why use Jaz?
Traditonal links simply redirect the user to an entirely new page, consequently removing the user, for at least a few moments, from the website's native experience. With Jaz, the user doesn't have to go to the new page, rather the new page comes to the user! This provides a seamless and smooth experience while traversing a website.

##Testing
While Jaz by itself is a standalone software, some tools and utilities are used for building and testing purposes. All of the required files are located in the `/test` directory for testing. Any dependencies will already be integrated into the test code, but for reference and documentation they will be listed below:
#####Dependencies
