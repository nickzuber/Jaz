# Jaz
###Dynamic web page rendering
Load and render web pages through the use of history API and AJAX to
provide a seamless and smooth transition. Jaz takes predetermined
contents of web pages and dynamically renders them onto the current
page, while asynchronously utilizing history API to navigate the user to
that web page, ultimately providing a smooth page transition.
